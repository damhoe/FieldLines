    <string name="text_help1">Given a vector field, the field lines are defined as the path through space that follows the direction of the field at any point. The derivative of with respect to the path parameter yields a tangent vector to the curve, which must be parallel to the field at every point. Hence, the path is required to be differentiable at all interior points.</string>
    <string name="text_help2">Closely related to the field lines are the equipotential surfaces, defined as the set of points with the same potential. The surface normals are aligned parallel to the field and, therefore, tangential to the field lines.</string>
    <string name="text_help3">Field lines and equipotential surfaces are useful for visualizing a field and its qualitative properties. In order to also depict the magnitude, a selection of field lines is drawn such that the density of field lines at any location is proportional to the magnitude of the field at that point. However, it is important to note that this interpretation becomes incorrect once two dimensional projections of a three dimensional field are drawn. It can be easily understood by considering a single point charge. The depicted density of field lines would be proportional to 1 / r whereas a correct result would yield a result of 1 / r2.\n\nUsing Gauss\'s law one can see that the flux into an area is determined by the charge enclosed by the surface.</string>
    <string name="text_help4">The electric field has sources at positive charges, sinks at negative charges, and neither elsewhere, so electric field lines start at positive charges and end at negative charges. They can also form closed loops, or extend to or from infinity, or continue forever without closing in on themselves.
        \n\nIn contrast, a gravitational field has no sources, it has sinks at masses, and it has neither elsewhere, gravitational field lines come from infinity and end at masses. A magnetic field has no sources or sinks, so its field lines have no start or end. They can only form closed loops, extend to infinity in both directions, or continue indefinitely without ever crossing itself.
